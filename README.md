# java-minesweeper

This is a simple command line version of Minesweeper.  

# Instruction on how to run the Minesweeper game:

To compile and run the code, the first step is to type [javac Minesweeper.java] into the command line. Next, you will want to run the game with
either a seed file or giving the command line 2 numbers after the run statement telling java the dimensions of the game board. You can do this
by either typing [java Minesweeper seedFile(.txt)] or [java Minesweeper (int) (int)]. The game is bound by a grid being no more than 10 rows
and 10 cols. Have a great time playing my Minesweeper.
